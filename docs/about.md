Flare is A Simple Expressive Web Framework for Java.

### Roadmap

Flare `v3` will have some enhancements to Spark `v2`. Here is some notes for the upcoming changes:

- It will have most of the bug fixes, we were waiting for.
- It will support modern LTS Java versions (Java 8, Java 11, Java 17).
- Migration from spark into flare will be minimal. Just a matter of changing import paths from `spark` to `flare` and rename classes to have `Flare` rather than `Spark`.

Flare `v4` upward will have a breaking changes, new features ... etc.
